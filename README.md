# Treasure-map

Instructions: 
A program which will mark a spot with an 💰.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
This map contains a nested list.
When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

The job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number.
